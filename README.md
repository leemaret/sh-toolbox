# sh-toolbox

Sometimes you just need a bit of useful bash.

## what this repository is for

This is where I keep useful snippets of `sh` scripts for use later. Some of the files are not working as they are written, because they are just snippets meant to be used as part of a larger script. I try to note these where possible but in all cases the scripts should be tested before use. 

The scripts and bits are organized roughly by purpose, such as reading in or writing out. Each directory has a README dedicated to indexing the bits within. The scripts themselves may have additional information within the comments.

## what this repository is not

This repository does not contain full CLI applications or fully-documented scripts for use directly. Curl and `| sh` at your own risk!
